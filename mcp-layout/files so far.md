ok so here is one of the errors stopping things from working ...

Thank you for the screenshot. It confirms that dragPanels.js script loaded! is appearing, and the Global mousedown event fired! is also showing up, along with the dragging class being applied to the panels.
However, the startDrag function called! and stopDrag function called! logs are still not appearing in your console. This is the core issue.
Since you confirmed that these console.log statements are present in the dragPanels.js file that is loaded in your DevTools "Sources" tab, and you have "All levels" selected in the console, this is highly unusual.

This is very perplexing. The fact that startDrag function called! and stopDrag function called! are still not appearing, even though the dragPanels.js script is loaded and the DOMContentLoaded event is firing, points to a very subtle issue.
We know the mousedown event is reaching the document (because "Global mousedown event fired!" appears), and we know the startDrag function is present in the loaded script. The disconnect is why the panel.addEventListener("mousedown", boundStartDrag); is not triggering the startDrag function.

    next phase 
1.  Event listeners are not correctly attached to the panels.
2.  An overlaying element is capturing mouse events.
3.  `e.target.closest('.panel')` is returning `null` in `startDrag`.
4.  CSS `pointer-events` property is preventing events from reaching panels.

**Action Plan:**
1.  **Verify Event Listener Attachment:** Add a `console.log` inside the `forEach` loop where event listeners are attached to confirm they are indeed being added to each panel.
2.  **Inspect `e.target` in `startDrag`:** Add `console.log(e.target);` and `console.log(e.target.closest('.panel'));` at the very beginning of the `startDrag` function to see what element is actually being clicked and if `closest('.panel')` finds the correct panel.
3.  **Check CSS `pointer-events`:** Instruct the user to inspect the CSS of the panels and any parent elements using browser developer tools to ensure `pointer-events` is not set to `none`.
4.  **Check Z-index:** Instruct the user to check the `z-index` of the panels and any potential overlaying elements.
